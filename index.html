              A 5-minute drive from Bassenthwaite Lake, Ravenstone Manor is an
              19th-century manor house set in 3 hectares of ground. The property
              is at the foot of Skiddaw, overlooking Bassenthwaite Lake. It
              offers stone walls and en suite bathrooms. The property's dining
              room mixes traditional and modern dishes based on locally sourced
              products. Dishes feature Cumbrian game and locally caught fish.
              The bar has an open fire, and the lounge has a warming fire and
              stunning views through the picture windows. Ravenstone Manor is a
              10-minute drive from Keswick and Derwent Water and 30 minutes from
              Penrith and the M6 motorway. Guests can go walking around the
              Northern Lakes, hiking and biking in the area. Couples
              particularly like the location — they rated it 9.4 for a
              two-person trip. We speak your language!

            <p>
              The 18th-century Royal Oak at Keswick is located in the market
              town of Keswick, just 2 miles from Derwentwater. A traditional
              pub, it offers home-cooked seasonal food, cask ales and cosy en
              suite accommodation. The Royal Oak at Keswick has elegant en suite
              rooms with either a power shower or bath. Each room has an LCD TV,
              facilities for making tea and coffee, and free Wi-Fi. In the
              restaurant, you can enjoy freshly prepared dishes made with local
              produce and seasonal ingredients from Cumbria. The bar stocks real
              ales from the Thwaites Brewery. With stunning views of the
              surrounding hills, the former coaching inn is close to the town
              centre. Keswick Lodge is a perfect base to explore the Lake
              District. The wholesome, fresh Cumbrian breakfasts gained a Highly
              Commended accolade in Britain's Best Pub Cooked Breakfast 2009.

              The heart of Keswick is the Market Square, ringed round with shops
              and hotels. There are no cars in the pedestrianised area which
              makes for a very pleasant shopping experience. The main building
              in the centre of the Market Square is The Moot Hall, an ancient
              foundation home to the Lake District National Park Tourist
              Information Centre and an excellent starting point for planning
              your adventures during your stay. It was built in 1813 on the site
              of an earlier building. It was used in the past as a covered
              market, a courthouse, Town Hall, a place of worship, a museum and
              a prison. Its one-handed clock strikes the hour only.
